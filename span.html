    <h3>Summary</h3>
    <p>
        Harry Potter is an orphaned boy living with his cruel aunt, uncle, and cousin. 
        On his 11th birthday, he learns that he is a wizard and has been accepted into <span style="color: red;">Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry</span>.
        A half-giant named Hagrid delivers the news and introduces him to the magical world.
    </p>
    <p>
        At Hogwarts, Harry befriends Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger, and is sorted into Gryffindor House.
        He also learns that he is famous in the wizarding world for surviving a killing curse from the dark wizard Lord Voldemort, who murdered his parents.
    </p>
    <p>
       As the school year progresses, Harry and his friends discover a hidden object called the Sorcerer’s Stone, which grants immortality. 
       They suspect that someone—possibly the sinister Professor Snape—is trying to steal it. 
    </p>
    <p>
        After several challenges, the trio reaches the Stone, only to find Professor Quirrell, not Snape, is the real villain. 
        Quirrell is being controlled by the weak and parasitic Voldemort, who is trying to return to power.
    </p>
    <p>
        Harry stops him, and the Stone is later destroyed by Dumbledore to prevent future misuse. 
        The movie ends with Harry returning to the Dursleys for the summer, but now with a new sense of belonging and identity.
